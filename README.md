## FACT OF THE DAY 21 BITCOIN COMPUTER TEST APP

This is a simple test app I wanted to build and test out by submitting to the 21.co Marketplace. 


First open the command line in your 21 Computer:

    $ git clone http://github.com/cponeill/21RandomFactApp.git
    $ cd 21RandomFactApp/

Run the server:

    $ python3 server.py

Open another terminal, change directory into 21RandomFactApp/static and run:

    $ python3 client.py

You should now see a random fact in your terminal. Oh the Joy!
